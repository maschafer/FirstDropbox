       <h2>About Stars</h2>
       <p>
        Most of the stars in our night sky and in the entire universe are main-sequence; also called dwarfs. Our beloved Sun is a main-sequence star, as well as the brightest star in our night sky â€“ Sirius. 
        These stars can vary in size, brightness, and mass, but they all have the same process happening in their cores. They are converting hydrogen to helium, creating a vast amount of energy.
       </p>

       <p>
        Supergiants are the largest stars in the universe. Supergiants are humongous and are dozens of times the mass of the Sun. Because these stars consume their hydrogen fuel at an accelerated rate, 
        they die out after only a few million years. When a supergiant star dies it creates a supernova explosion and completely disintegrates in the process.
