  I am so tired right now that all I want to do is sleep because I have to get up at 7 am and go to work for 8 hours tomorrow. This is what I get for putting this off until the last minute.
  I know that I am making this harder than it is. It is a little confusing because the instructions are done on a Mac and I am using Windows, so screens don't always look the same.
