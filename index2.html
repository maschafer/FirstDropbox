            <h2>Information about Cats</h2>
            <h3>"The best cats are mixed breeds that have been socialized."</h3>
            <h4>"They are all so cute!"</h4>
            <p>
People who do not own cats think that they are aloof, mean animals that do not like people and do not want anything to do with people. This depends on how the cats were socialized as
kittens. If a kitten was abused by young children, or even mean adults, they will be mean and mistrust people. But if they are shown love and affection as kittens they grow up to be
loving, affectionate cats. They still have their moments when they will not want to be held, but people are like that, too.

            <p>
Not all cats are "lap cats" but as they become older they rely on their owners to help them when they can no longer jump as high as they used to. My sixteen year old cat was never a 
lap cat, but she is now because she likes to stay warm and wants me as her source of warmth. She still does not want to be picked up and held unless it is her idea.
