            <h1>About Rainbows</h1>
            <p>
              A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets. The most familiar type rainbow is 
              produced when sunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). Rainbows 
              can also be viewed around fog, sea spray, or waterfalls. A rainbow is an optical illusion—it does not 
              actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. The appearance of a rainbow depends on where you're 
              standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining.

                Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point is the center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft 
                can sometimes see these circular rainbows. Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops 
                above the horizon. Because each person's horizon is a little different, no one actually sees a full rainbow 
                from the ground. In fact, no one sees the same rainbow—each person has a different antisolar point, each person 
                has a different horizon. Someone who appears below or near the "end" of a rainbow to one viewer will see another 
                rainbow, extending from his or her own horizon.

            When sunlight hits a rain droplet, some of the light is reflected. The electromagnetic spectrum is made of light with 
            many different wavelengths, and each is reflected at a different angle. Thus, spectrum is separated, producing a rainbow.
            Red has the longest wavelength of visible light, about 650 nanometers. It usually appears on the outer part of a rainbow's 
            arch. Violet has the shortest wavelength (about 400 nanometers) and it usually appears on the inner arch of the rainbow.
